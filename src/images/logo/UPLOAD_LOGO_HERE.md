# Upload Your Loop Revenue System Logo Here

## Instructions

1. **Save your logo PNG file** as: `loop-logo.png`
2. **Upload it to this directory**: `/src/images/logo/`
3. **Recommended specifications**:
   - Width: 500-750px (will be displayed at 250px for quality)
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - File name: `loop-logo.png`

## Current Setup

All HTML pages are configured to use:
```html
<img src="/src/images/logo/loop-logo.png" alt="Loop Revenue System" />
```

Once you upload `loop-logo.png` to this directory, it will automatically appear on all pages.

## File Location

Place your file here:
```
/home/user/looprevenuesystem/src/images/logo/loop-logo.png
```

Or via git:
```bash
# Add your logo file
git add src/images/logo/loop-logo.png

# Commit it
git commit -m "Add Loop Revenue System logo PNG"

# Push to your branch
git push
```

## Fallback

Currently using: `loop-logo.svg` as a placeholder until PNG is uploaded.
