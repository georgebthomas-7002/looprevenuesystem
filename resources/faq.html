                        <h3>What is the Loop Revenue System?</h3>
                        <p>The Loop Revenue System is a comprehensive framework for building predictable, scalable revenue operations. It connects four essential Loops (Marketing, Sales, Service, and Ops) into one unified system where every customer interaction creates data, insights, and continuous improvement.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ds-card">
                        <h3>Who is the Loop for?</h3>
                        <p>The Loop is designed for B2B companies, professional services firms, and any business that wants to create systematic, repeatable revenue growth. It works for teams of 5 to 500+, from startups to established enterprises.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ds-card">
                        <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
                        <p>You can launch your first Loop (Express stage) in 30 days. Most companies see meaningful results in 60-90 days. Full implementation across all four Loops typically takes 6-12 months, depending on your current state and complexity.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ds-card">
                        <h3>Do I need to implement all four Loops at once?</h3>
                        <p>No. Most teams start with one or two Loops based on their biggest pain points. You can build incrementally, adding Loops as you're ready. The system is designed to grow with you.</p>

                        <p>No. While we have a specialized HubSpot Implementation Playbook, the Loop works with any CRM or go-to-market tech stack. We provide guidance for both HubSpot and non-HubSpot implementations.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely. The Loop is built for the AI era. Our AI and Humans Playbook shows exactly how to integrate AI capabilities into each Loop while maintaining the human judgment that drives real results.</p>

                        <p>Companies typically see 20-40% improvements in conversion rates, 30-60% reductions in sales cycle time, and 40-50% increases in customer retention within the first year. Results vary by starting point and implementation quality.</p>

                    <div class="ds-card">
                        <h3>How do I measure Loop performance?</h3>
                        <p>The Loop includes a comprehensive metrics framework with specific KPIs for each stage and each Loop. You'll track both operational metrics (cycle time, conversion rates) and business outcomes (revenue, retention, efficiency).</p>

                        <p>Quick wins typically appear within 30-60 days (improved visibility, faster handoffs, fewer dropped leads). Meaningful revenue impact usually shows in 90-180 days. Compounding benefits build over time as Loops mature.</p>

                        <h3>What's the ROI of implementing the Loop?</h3>
                        <p>ROI depends on your current inefficiencies and growth goals. Most companies find the system pays for itself within 6 months through improved conversion rates, faster cycles, and reduced churn. See our case studies for specific examples.</p>
